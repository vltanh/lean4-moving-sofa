"""Check that each formal proof follows the route of the paper's proof.

The *route* of a proof is the set of numbered results of the paper that it uses. For the paper,
these are the results that the proof cites (`\\cref`, `\\Cref`, `\\ref`, `\\autoref`); for the
formalization, the numbered results that the Lean proof reaches through the library's helper
lemmas, which `scripts/Audit.lean` (from the skill's `assets/`) writes to `.lake/route_deps.tsv`.
A formal proof that follows the paper's argument cites the same results. Every difference is
either a proof to fix or a departure from the paper to record.

    route_check.py extract main.tex [MORE.tex | DIR ...] > docs/paper_routes.tsv
    route_check.py check docs/paper_routes.tsv [--deps .lake/route_deps.tsv]
                         [--accept docs/route_differences.tsv]

`extract` reads the TeX source, following `\\input` and `\\include` from each file given (a
directory stands for its `.tex` files in sorted order), and writes one line per labelled
statement of a theorem-like environment: its label, its environment, whether the paper proves it
(1 or 0), and the labels of the statements that its proof cites. A proof belongs to the statement
named in its optional argument (`\\begin{proof}[Proof of \\Cref{thm:a}]`), and otherwise to the
closest statement before it. The output contains only labels, so it can be committed even when
the TeX source cannot be.

`check` maps each Lean result to the first code span of its docstring that is a label of the
paper (write the label in backticks in the docstring of every numbered result), and compares the
two routes of every result that the paper proves:

- `-X`: the paper's proof cites X, and the Lean proof never reaches X, not even through the
  results it uses: it avoids a step of the paper's argument;
- `+X`: the Lean proof uses X, and the paper's argument does not reach X, not even through the
  results its proof cites.

A difference that the other route explains is not reported (`--all` shows it too): a cited result
that the Lean proof reaches through another result, or a result that the Lean proof uses directly
where the paper reaches it through a cited result. Each reported difference must be reviewed. Either the Lean proof is changed to follow the paper, or the
difference is recorded in the accept file, one line per difference, `LABEL<TAB>±OTHER<TAB>reason`
(lines starting with `#` are comments): for example a departure from the paper's proof, which is
also reported in the docstring and in the report, or a result that the paper's proof uses without
citing it. `*<TAB>+OTHER<TAB>reason` records a result that the paper uses without citing it
throughout, such as a basic property of its objects. The command exits with status 1 if a difference is not in the accept file, or if an
entry of the accept file no longer describes a difference.
